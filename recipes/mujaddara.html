        <h3>Description</h3>
        <p>Enjoy a great tasting dish to share with family and friends. 
            Special dish for vegetarians, and one of our favorite meals. 
            Instead of placing the onion on top you can mix it along with 
            the lentils and rice before serving. It makes a perfect meal with 
            a fresh green salad. Also you can use 2 cups of vegetable broth 
            instead of 2 cups of water to cook the lentils.</p>
        
        <h3>Ingredients</h3>
        <ul>
            <li>1 cup dry lentils, rinsed</li>
            <li>2 cups water</li>
            <li>1 teaspoon salt</li>
            <li>1 tablespoon ground cumin</li>
            <li>1 tablespoon garlic powder</li>
            <li>3/4 cup white rice, rinsed</li>
            <li>3/4 cup water</li>
            <li>1 teaspoon salt</li>
            <li>2 tablespoons olive oil</li>
            <li>1/4 cup vegetable oil</li>
            <li>3 white onions, sliced into 1/4 inch rings</li>
        </ul>

        <h3>Steps</h3>
        <ol>
            <li>Combine the lentils, 2 cups water, 1 teaspoon salt, the cumin, 
                and garlic powder in a pot over medium heat; bring to a 
                simmer, reduce heat to low, and cook until the lentils begin 
                to soften, 20 to 30 minutes.</li>
            <li>Stir the rice, 3/4 cup water, 1 teaspoon salt, and the olive 
                oil into the lentils. Cover the pot and continue cooking until 
                the lentils and rice are tender, about 40 minutes.</li>
            <li>Heat the cooking oil in a skillet over medium heat; cook the 
                onions in the oil until browned, 7 to 10 minutes. Spread the 
                onions over the rice and lentil mixture to serve.</li>
        </ol>
